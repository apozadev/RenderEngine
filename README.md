<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Data-driven C++ Engine using Vulkan.

Main objectives:
* Must be flexible enough to render many different effects using a configurable pipeline.
* Use runtime reflection to save, load and compile assets.
* Data orientation FTW.

### Prerequisites

Remember to run 
```console
git submodule update --init
```
after cloning the repository. You also must have installed the Vulkan SDK before running cmake.
